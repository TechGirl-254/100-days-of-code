# 100-days-of-code
This repository holds all the content of my 100 days of code challenge.
First, I start with simple projects, just to create consistency in coding daily.
As the days advance, so will the nature of the projects.
The main aim here is to build a coding culture for 100 days straight.

# day-1_band_name_generator
This is the first project here. It's a simple name generator taht takes input from a user, and uses screen concatenation to generate a new name.
The lessons learned here include:
  1. How to handle user input
  2. COnverting input to strings
  3. String concatenation

# day-2_bmi_calculator
This project takes weight and height input from a user and manipulates it to get their BMI. The main challenge I faced with creating this was:
  1. How to ensure the calucator detected when the user entereed values that can't be converted to integers. I kept getting a         TypeError, and the try and except block wasn't working optimally.
However, I managed to resolve it, and learnt the following valuable lessons.
  1. How to use try and except blocks for multiple checks.
  2. Conversion of string inputs to other input types that can work with mathematical operators.
  3. How to check the type of an int or float in a comparative scenario.
